# pwn_4_graduation
# overview
## level_1 basic stack overflows
1. considering design series of stack-overflows challenges like **ret2text**,**ret2shellcode**,**ret2syscall**
2. higher-level difficulty challenges like **ret2libc**
3. maybe set some vulnerabilities like **int overflow**,**canary leakage** before ret2XXX

## level_2 basic format string bug challenges
`TODO`
## level_3 basic heap overflows
`TODO`

# challenges
## pwn_1

## pwn_2
from *NPUCTF2018*
